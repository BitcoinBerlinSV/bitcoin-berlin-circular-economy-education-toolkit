# Merchant Onboarding Guide
## Bitcoin Berlin Circular Economy Toolkit

This guide documents the practical process used by Bitcoin Berlin to onboard merchants to accept Bitcoin payments in real circular economies.

It is designed for community educators, organizers, and field teams supporting merchants for the first time. The focus is on simplicity, trust-building, and real-world usability.

---

## Goal

Help merchants begin accepting Bitcoin payments in a way that is:
- simple
- safe
- voluntary
- confidence-building

The objective is not to pressure adoption, but to open the door and provide ongoing support.

## 1. The First Conversation (Before Technology)

The onboarding process always begins with a **human conversation**, not an app install.

### Suggested talking points
Use natural language and adapt to the merchant’s context:

- “Bitcoin is just another way to get paid, like cash or card.”
- “Many tourists actively look for places where they can pay with Bitcoin.”
- “In Berlín and nearby communities, over 170 businesses already accept it.”
- “The wallet works like WhatsApp — if you can use a phone, you can use this.”
- “You can choose whether to keep payments in Bitcoin or dollars.”
- “If you ever want to convert to cash, there are local options.”

### Important
- Do not insist.
- Do not rush.
- If the merchant is unsure, thank them and leave the door open.

Trust comes first.

## 2. Pre-Onboarding Checklist

Before starting the technical setup, confirm:

- The merchant has a smartphone
- The phone has internet access (mobile data or Wi-Fi)
- The merchant has access to their email or phone number
- They understand this is optional and reversible

## 3. Wallet Setup (Example: Blink)

> This guide uses Blink as an example due to its ease of use for merchants. Other wallets may also work.

### Step 1: Install the wallet
- Download from the App Store or Play Store
- Register using an email address or phone number
- Set a secure PIN
- Enable biometric lock if available
- Optional: enable 2FA

### Step 2: First practice transaction
- Send and receive a very small amount
- Show how to:
  - receive payments
  - send payments
  - view transaction history
- Explain invoice types:
  - Lightning invoices usually start with `ln`
  - On-chain addresses often start with `bc1`, `1`, or `3`

Practice builds confidence.

## 4. POS and Employee Setup (If Applicable)

If the business has employees:

- Create a Lightning username (example: `cafebar@blink.sv`)
- Activate POS / Cash Register mode
- Use a dedicated phone or tablet if possible
- Avoid giving employees full wallet access
- Confirm employees cannot see or move funds

This protects both the merchant and the staff.

---

## 5. Basic Security Practices

Explain clearly:

> “Opening a wallet is like opening a bank account.  
> What’s inside is real money.”

### Recommended practices
- Use a strong PIN (avoid birthdays or simple numbers)
- Enable biometric locking
- Use an email the merchant can always access
- Do not share access with employees or family
- Hide the wallet balance when possible
- Do not use custodial wallets for long-term savings

Clarify that custodial wallets are for **daily use**, not savings.

---

## 6. Printed QR Codes (Optional)

For convenience:

- Generate a static QR code from the wallet
- Print and laminate if possible
- Explain the flow:
  - Customer scans
  - Customer enters amount
  - Merchant confirms payment notification

Always confirm the payment before delivering the product.

---

## 7. Community Integration

After onboarding:

- Add the merchant to the local Bitcoin business group (WhatsApp or similar)
- Announce the new business:
  - business name
  - photo
  - location
- Offer continued support:
  - questions
  - troubleshooting
  - follow-up visits

Bitcoin adoption works best as a community process.

---

## 8. Common Merchant Questions (FAQ)

### “Is this legal?”
Yes. Bitcoin can be used as a payment method by mutual agreement.

### “What if Bitcoin’s price changes?”
Many wallets allow receiving payments in dollar-equivalent balances (e.g. stablesats).

### “Do I pay fees?”
Lightning fees are usually paid by the customer and are typically very small.

### “Do I need a registered business?”
No. Formal registration is not required to receive Bitcoin.

### “What if I lose my phone?”
Access can be recovered if the merchant still controls their email, phone number, or recovery method.

## 9. Field Tips for Educators

- Always demonstrate with real examples
- Be patient
- Never force adoption
- Leave printed materials when possible
- Use nearby success stories as references
- Focus on confidence, not speed

---

## 10. Ongoing Support

Adoption does not end with the first payment.

Plan for:
- follow-up visits
- practice sessions
- answering questions
- updating merchants as tools improve

Bitcoin adoption is a process, not a one-time event.
