# Maintenance Notes

This repository documents real-world Bitcoin merchant onboarding practices used by Bitcoin Berlin in live circular economies.

The content here is expected to evolve slowly and deliberately, based on:
- direct field experience
- merchant feedback
- changes in tooling and best practices
- clarity improvements for non-technical users

## Update approach

Changes are made conservatively. The goal is stability and usefulness rather than rapid expansion.

Typical updates may include:
- clarifying language
- adding or refining examples
- documenting common issues observed in practice
- adjusting guidance as tools or wallets change

## Scope discipline

This repository intentionally avoids:
- speculative features
- untested workflows
- theoretical content not used in practice

Only material that has been applied in real onboarding contexts is included.

## Community input

Suggestions, corrections, and improvements are welcome via issues and pull requests, especially when based on real usage or local adaptation.

All contributions should prioritize:
- simplicity
- security awareness
- respect for user autonomy
