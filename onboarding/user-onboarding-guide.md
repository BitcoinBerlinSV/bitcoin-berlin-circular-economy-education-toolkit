## 1. What Bitcoin is (in simple terms)

Bitcoin is a form of digital money.

- It can be used on a phone
- You can send and receive it directly
- You do not need a bank account
- It works the same for everyone

In places like Berlín and La Laguna, Bitcoin is mainly used as **a payment method**, similar to cash or card.

---

## 2. Bitcoin as a payment option

Bitcoin is a payment option people can choose to use in everyday life.

At first, many people use it alongside other forms of money.  
Over time, as they gain confidence, they often choose to use it more.

What matters is learning how it works and using it in real situations.

## 3. Two ways Bitcoin is used

Most wallets show two types of payments.

### Lightning payments
- Very fast
- Very low fees
- Used for small, everyday payments
- Common in shops, cafés, and markets

### On-chain payments
- Slower
- Higher fees
- Used less often for daily spending

In local circular economies, **Lightning** is the most common option.

## 4. Receiving a Bitcoin payment

When someone pays you in Bitcoin:

1. Open your wallet
2. Create a QR code or invoice
3. The customer scans it
4. You wait for confirmation

Always confirm the payment before giving the product or service.

---

## 5. Making a payment

To pay with Bitcoin:

- Scan the QR code
- Check the amount
- Confirm the payment

If you are unsure, stop and ask.  
There is no problem taking your time.

---

## 6. Bitcoin balance and prices

Bitcoin prices can change.

Some wallets show:
- Bitcoin balance
- Dollar-equivalent balance

For daily use:
- Focus on whether the payment worked
- Do not worry about short-term price changes

---

## 7. Basic safety habits

Bitcoin gives you control over your money.

Simple habits help keep it safe:
- Use a PIN
- Enable fingerprint or face lock
- Do not share your wallet access
- Be careful with screenshots
- Do not trust strangers offering help online

If something feels wrong, pause and ask for help.

## 8. If you lose your phone

If your phone is lost or damaged:
- Access may be recovered using:
  - your email
  - your phone number
  - wallet recovery options

Ask a local Bitcoin educator or trusted community member as soon as possible.
